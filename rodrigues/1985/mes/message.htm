<p>The newly-created Organização Comunista “Política Operária”( “Workers’ Policy” Communist Organization) takes upon itself the duty to inform the marxist-leninist organizations and parties on both the conditions under which it arose and its purposes.</p>
<p>OCPO follows from a split in the PC(R) (Reconstructed Communist Party) by the end of last year and subsequent to an internal struggle which had been progressing for some time. As a matter of fact, in March 1983, the 4th PC(R) Congress deeply criticized all the previous party activity. The Congress concluded that the party policy had been ruled as from its foundation by a centrist platform corresponding to a compromise between the working class and the petty-bourgeoisie, and expressed by the following political items:</p>
<p>— the “via do 25 de Abril do povo” (path towards the People’s 25th April) as a general tactics confined the party strategy to the mere search of a transition government, in coalition with radical democratic forces;</p>
<p>— the party overestimated the potentialities of the working and popular movement during the 1974/75 political crisis, in order to smooth the constant political subordination of the proletariat to the “left-hand” petty-bourgeoisie;</p>
<ul>
<li>The petty-bourgeois character of the revisionist party was never acknowledged, to avoid the unquestionable critique to the petty-bourgeoisie;</li>
<li>The resistance to differentiate between the proletariat’s interests and those of the other popular classes also led to concealing the party political points of view behind those of the UDP (Popular Democratic Union);</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the centrist “via do 25 de Abril do povo” was the source of the party wavering (particularly its Central Committee) on the occasion of the 1979 and 1982 right opportunist platforms and fractions;</p>
<p>— the so-called “policy for the Million” became as from 1979 the attempt to gain mass support to the “via do 25 de Abril do povo”; while concentrating ideological struggle on “sectarism”, such a policy prevented the party from bolshevizing itself, on the contrary, its influence within the working class progressively decreasing.</p>
<p>The 4th PC (R) Congress so concluded that by attempting to fuse the revolutionary interests of the working class and the reformism of the democratic petty bourgeoisie together was preventing from raising a proletarian and revolutionary vanguard, was perpetuating the working class political nonage, was setting bounds to the struggle against revisionism, was implementing permanent crisis in the party and leading it towards opportunist degeneracy.</p>
<p>Finally the Congress defined new tactics foundations, their guiding purpose being the hegemony of proletariat; entrusted the Central Committee with the duty of wording out a program; pointed out the need for systematic struggle against rigthist opportunism and centrism; outlined a plan to bolshevize the party on the basis of strong factory cells; etc.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Congress, nevertheless the new elected Central Committee started showing resistances to carry on in practice the turning point demanded by the party supreme instance; clipped all the critique to centrism; postponed the main tasks entrusted by the congress. In coalition with the party right wing it started attacking the left wing which had been at the origin of 4th Congress.</p>
<p>Later on, with no respect for the Congress decisions, the Central Committee forbade the debate in the different party organizative structures; overturn the party organizative rules; and calumniated the party’s left wing under the epithet of “anarchist-trotskist”. So, for mere nothings, three members of the Central Committee and several others belonging to regional committees who had been fighting for putting into practice the Congress decisions were dismissed and sent back to the basis.</p>
<p>This anti-leninist process met its end point in October- November 1984, when 40 PC(R) members (3 of them belonging to the CC, 8 from regional oommitees, almost all the redactors of the central organ) have left the party. These 40 members became so the source of the new organization.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of OC “PO”‘ to develop its propaganda and organizative activities within the working class. This task will be mostly fulfilled by the regular issue of a magazine of marxist-leninist critique, which should lay the programmatic, strategic, tactic end statutory foundations of the future Communist Party, whose construction is urgent in Portugal.</p>
<p>It is for us clear that PC (R) can no longer become such a party. Furthermore, it is our aim to help forward overcoming the crisis which overwhelms the international narxist-leninist movement.</p>
<p>Among the theoretical and ideological questions to be clarified in “Política Operária” (Workers’ Policy), from a marxist-leninist standpoint, we point out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a critical balance of the general political line which ruled the international communist movement and the Soviet Union within the period of 1930-50 and whose centrist nature is the source o<b>f</b> the revisionism in the 20th CPSU Congress. Such a balance includes, namely:</li>
<li>a critical balance of the period of socialist construction, the degeneracy process in USSR and the role of Stalin, as main questions o Marxism in our daysa balance of the role of Mao Tsetang and maoism in the degeneracy of the Chinese Revolution;</li>
<li>a critique to the 7th Congress of the Comintern, the Dimitrov’s report and hisUnique Front policy the source of de degeneracy forcommunist parties in the capitalist countries;</li>
<li>a critique to the theory of Popular Democracy as a forgery of the leninist theory on revolution and the cause of degeneracy in the eastern European regimes</li>
<li>a critique to the course of the international narxist-leninist current within the past 25 years as an incomplete rupture with revisionism and a frustrated attempt to lengthen centrism, what caused its present crisis;</li>
<li>a critique to the Labour Party of Albany regarding its attitudes within the framework of either internal or external policy during these past few years, such as its diplomatic and cultural relations with the fascist regimes of Turkey and Iran, the Mehmet Shehu affair, etc., which remain inexplicable from a marxist-leninist standpoint;</li>
<li>the return to the leninist principles of democratic centralism against both the “monolithic” deformation inherited from the centrist period and the coexistence of antagonic lines defining the maoism;</li>
<li>practical initiatives and concrete proposals to gather the efforts for all true marxist-leninist parties and organizations, their purpose being the reconstruction of the Comintern as soon as the minimum required political conditions have been reached;</li>
<li>the definition of the communist strategy in Portugal, according to the socialist character of revolution and following from the recognition of the proletariat-bourgeoisie contradiction as the main existing contradiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is our aim to be able to reach such purpose in unity with the Marxist-leninists of all countries.</p>
